# ADS_project

This is my project for the course "Advanced Data Science".

- the file "complete_Dataset.Rdata" contains the dataset that I made and used for the project,
- the folder "All mtg DataBase" contains the file with all the information about the cards,
- the folder "MTG Modern Decks April" contains the process I followed to build the dataset.
